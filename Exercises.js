// Q1 Create a variable called myPet and assign it a string value "Dog"

let myPet = "Dog";

// Q2 Create a variable called petName and assign it a string value "Rex"

petName = "Rex";

// Q3 Create a variable called petAge and assign it a number value 6

petAge = 6;

// Q4 Use string concatenation to print to the console so the output is 
//"I have a Dog called Rex who is 6 years old".

console.log("I have a " + myPet + " called " + petName + " who is " + petAge + " years old.");

// Q5 Use string interpolation to print the same output to the console

console.log(`I have a ${myPet} called ${petName} who is ${petAge} years old.`);

// Q6 Update petAge by using the Addition operator to increase its value by 2

console.log(petAge);
petAge = 6+2;
console.log(petAge);

// Q6 Call the same statement from question 4 or 5 again after updating the petAge

console.log("I have a " + myPet + " called " + petName + " who is " + petAge + " years old.");
console.log(`I have a ${myPet} called ${petName} who is ${petAge} years old.`);
